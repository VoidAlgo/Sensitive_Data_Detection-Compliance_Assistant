"""Detection orchestrator: run all detectors → deduped, located ``Finding[]``.

This is the single entry point the UI and later phases use. It composes the
deterministic pattern detectors, the spaCy NER pass, and the LLM contextual pass,
attaches page/line/column provenance by mapping character spans back to document
segments, and de-duplicates overlapping spans (preferring the longer span, then
the more trustworthy detector). Values are already masked by the individual
detectors.
