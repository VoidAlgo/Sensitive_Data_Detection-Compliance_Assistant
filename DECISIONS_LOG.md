# DECISIONS LOG

Significant engineering decisions, trade-offs, spec challenges, and auto-applied
minor improvements — with rationale.

## Post-build — End-to-end evaluation findings

A live evaluation against the bundled samples (rather than unit tests alone)
surfaced four defects that only appear when the whole pipeline runs:

- **D50 — Never report an unread document as clean.** A scanned, image-only PDF
  extracted 0 characters, so detection found nothing and the UI showed a green
  "No sensitive data detected" at Low risk. For a compliance tool that false
  assurance is the worst failure mode. `Document.empty_pages` now counts pages
  that stayed below the OCR sparsity threshold (reusing `needs_ocr`, so the
  "too sparse to trust" rule has one definition), and `extraction_warning()`
  returns a user-facing caveat that the Overview and Findings tabs render. The
  success message is downgraded to "No sensitive data was found in the text that
  could be read" whenever extraction was incomplete.
- **D51 — Filter spaCy structurally, not with a growing stoplist.** On form-like
  "Label: value" documents spaCy (trained on prose) tagged field labels (`PAN`,
  `Credit Card`), ran spans across line breaks (`John Doe\nEmail`), and flagged
  ordinary words (`checksum`) as ORG. Redaction then turned `Name:` into
  `[REDACTED:ORG]:` and the risk score inflated. Rather than enumerate bad terms,
  three general rules apply: clip spans at the first newline, reject spans
  followed by (or containing) a colon since those are labels whose values the
  deterministic detectors already own, and reject all-lowercase spans. The
  `NOT_A_NAME` vocabulary was promoted from `detection.names` and shared instead
  of duplicated. Result on the golden file: 8 spaCy findings → 4, all field
  labels preserved in the sanitized output.
- **D52 — Scope the LLM pass to what regex cannot do.** The contextual prompt was
  re-listing every structured identifier the checksum detectors had already found
  (8 of 12 findings were duplicates), spending the response budget re-deriving
  known values. The prompt now explicitly excludes them. Findings dropped 12 → 1
  and the pass got ~42% faster (8.5s → 4.9s), cutting total detection latency by
  a third — the LLM pass is ~77–85% of it.
- **D53 — Fingerprint the findings that masked a cached index.** Indexes persist
  keyed by document hash, but that hash covers only the document *bytes* — not the
  detection results that decided what was masked before embedding. After the fixes
  above, the on-disk index still served chunk text redacted under the old rules.
  The dangerous direction is worse: a detector improvement that finds a *new* kind
  of PII would leave it exposed in every pre-existing index. `findings_fingerprint()`
  (in `redaction.masker`, next to the masking rules) hashes each finding's span and
  type; `FaissStore.matches()` reuses a cached index only on an exact match, and
  legacy fingerprint-less indexes are treated as stale. Cache hits for unchanged
  findings still skip the rebuild.

## Post-build — Address completeness (PIN code + house/age number leaks)

A real Aadhaar showed the postal PIN code (`630302`) and the age/house-number
immediately after "S/O: <father>," surviving redaction — both **deterministic,
model-independent** fixes:

- **D48 — Two new PIN-code detectors.** `pincode-keyword` (`PIN Code:` / `Pincode:`
  / `Pin:` + 6 digits) and `pincode-suffix` (the `"<State> - NNNNNN"` idiom common
  at the end of an address line on Indian ID cards, anchored to end-of-line to
  avoid matching unrelated dash-separated numbers). Both classified `LOCATION`
  (no new entity type needed).
- **D49 — Positional address-number detector (`_detect_trailing_address_numbers`
  in engine.py).** A bare 1–3 digit number immediately followed by a comma, right
  after ANY detected PERSON finding — regardless of which detector found that
  person (regex, spaCy, or the multilingual LLM pass) or what script the name is
  in. This is why it's positional rather than a language-specific regex: it also
  catches the number following a Tamil name that only the LLM pass can read.
  Whitespace matching spans newlines, since PDF extraction often puts each
  comma-separated address field on its own line even though it renders as one
  visual line. Classified `LOCATION` (address component, not identity data alone).
  Runs after all PERSON-producing detectors, before dedupe.
- Both fixes are deterministic — they work identically whether or not an LLM call
  succeeds, unlike the multilingual place-name detection (D40–D43) which depends
  on the Gemini verification pass and can vary by which model in the rotation
  serves the call. Regression tests: `tests/test_address_completeness.py` (10).

## Post-verification bug fixes (from VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md §4)

- **D35 — Dedup ranks trust before span length (critical).** `engine._dedupe`
  sorted `(span_len, rank, conf)`, so a longer low-trust spaCy/LLM span could evict
  an inner deterministic finding (reproduced: spaCy tagged `email=alice@example.com`
  as ORG and dropped the EMAIL). Reordered to `(rank, span_len, conf)`. Equal-rank
  overlaps (CREDIT_CARD vs AADHAAR, both rank 5) still fall back to span length, so
  the card still wins. Regression tests added.
- **D36 — LLM JSON parsed with `strict=False` (high).** `_parse_findings` used
  strict `json.loads`, which rejects literal newlines/tabs inside string values and
  silently returned `[]` — dropping multi-line confidential snippets. `strict=False`
  tolerates control chars in strings (a safe superset).
- **D37 — Case-insensitive PAN / IFSC / EMPLOYEE_ID (medium).** Added
  `re.IGNORECASE` to the PAN/IFSC specs and `(?i)` to the default `employee_id_
  pattern` so lowercase occurrences are caught. `value_raw` preserves original case.
- **D38 — Password label may be quoted (medium).** Regex now allows optional quotes
  around the `password` label (`'password': '…'`), matching JSON/dict-style creds;
  the length≥4 guard still skips empty passwords.
- **D39 — Conservative international phone (low).** Added a second PHONE spec
  requiring a leading `+country` code (`\+\d{1,3}(?:[\s-]?\d){6,12}`); the mandatory
  `+` prefix keeps false positives low. Indian spec remains primary (higher rank).

## Phase 1

- **D1 — Config via `pydantic-settings` as single source of truth.** All tunables
  (model registry, thresholds, weights, chunking, redaction) live in `config.py`,
  never redeclared. Rationale: enforces the single-source-of-truth rule and gives
  typed validation. Trade-off: a small amount of boilerplate vs. plain dicts.

- **D2 — Model registry as data, not code.** Free-tier model names/limits change
  often, so they live in `DEFAULT_MODEL_REGISTRY` (config) with a `ModelSpec`
  type, and business logic reads them. **Action required:** verify current values
  at https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits before finalizing.

- **D3 — Dataclasses (not pydantic) for `Finding`/`Document`.** These are hot,
  in-memory transfer objects; stdlib dataclasses are lighter and need no
  validation overhead. Pydantic is reserved for settings/boundary validation.

- **D4 (minor, auto-applied) — `StrEnum` instead of `(str, Enum)`.** Ruff UP042.
  Cleaner string semantics for JSON/logging/UI; requires Python 3.11+, which the
  project already targets.

- **D5 — `Finding.value_raw` kept in-memory only.** Privacy rule: raw values never
  reach logs, the vector index, or the UI unless explicitly revealed. Masking is
  applied at detection time; surfaces use `value_masked`.

- **D6 — Env prefix `SDA_` with `GEMINI_API_KEY` aliased.** Namespaces our own
  settings while keeping the conventional secret name. Verified the alias reads
  the unprefixed variable.

## Phase 2

- **D7 — Single `load_document()` dispatch by extension.** One ingestion entry
  point returning `Document`; UI/detection depend only on that contract.
- **D8 — Retain the CSV DataFrame in `Document.metadata`.** Enables column-level
  detection (naming the offending column) without re-parsing. Trade-off: keeps a
  DataFrame in memory; acceptable for single-doc processing.
- **D9 — OCR isolated + config-gated, replaces text only if it yields more.**
  Ingestion degrades gracefully when Tesseract is absent (local env has no
  binary); Docker image installs it (P10).

## Phase 3

- **D10 — Sliding-window RPM/TPM in memory, RPD persisted.** 60s windows are
  ephemeral (safe to lose on restart); the daily counter must survive restarts so
  it is written to a small JSON keyed by date. Rationale: correctness of the daily
  cap without a database.
- **D11 — Injectable clock + isolated `_invoke_sdk`.** Makes the entire rotation
  engine deterministically testable (fake clock, simulated 429/5xx) with no
  network or SDK dependency in tests.
- **D12 — Raise `AllModelsExhausted` instead of long blocking waits.** Predictable
  behavior and lets callers degrade to deterministic fallbacks; `seconds_until_
  available` is exposed for optional short waits/UI but not used to block.
- **D13 — Error classification by status code + class name + message.** Robust to
  the SDK not being importable in tests and to message-only rate-limit signals.

## Phase 4

- **D14 — Masking centralized in `redaction/masker.mask_value`.** Detection imports
  it so masking rules exist in exactly one place (reused by P8 export). Coupling
  detection→redaction is acceptable; both only depend on `models`.
- **D15 — Low base confidence + checksum boost for Aadhaar/card.** Regex-only
  matches score 0.4; a passing Verhoeff/Luhn raises to 0.99. Encodes that the
  checksum, not the regex, is what makes these trustworthy.
- **D16 (minor, auto-applied) — Global "reveal" checkbox instead of per-row
  toggle.** Cleaner in Streamlit and identical privacy guarantee (masked by
  default, explicit opt-in). Spec suggested per-row; deviation noted here.
- **D17 — Overlap dedupe by (span length, detector trust, confidence).** Ensures a
  real card is not shadowed by a coincidental Aadhaar/LLM span; deterministic
  detectors outrank NER/LLM on ties.
- **D18 — LLM snippets verified verbatim against source text.** Any snippet not
  found by exact substring match is discarded — concrete anti-hallucination guard.

## Post-build — Optional reranker + privacy local-only mode

- **D33 — Cross-encoder reranker as an opt-in, GPU-aware toggle.** Off by default so
  the fast path is unaffected. When on, `_retrieve()` pulls a larger pool then
  reranks with a `CrossEncoder`. Model choice is GPU-aware: lightweight
  `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` on CPU, auto-upgrade to `bge-reranker-v2-m3` when CUDA is
  present (needs a CUDA torch build). Reranker only reorders — the returned score
  stays the dense cosine, so the `rag_min_score` refusal contract is preserved
  (verified). Loads lazily and degrades to unranked hits on any failure. No new
  dependency (`sentence-transformers` ships `CrossEncoder`).
- **D34 — Privacy local-only mode.** A config flag + runtime sidebar toggle that
  makes `_provider_available()` block all cloud Gemini models, forcing the local
  Ollama backend so no document-derived text (even masked) leaves the machine —
  a strong compliance option for the most sensitive documents. Reuses the existing
  provider-gating seam; `is_configured` degrades correctly if no local backend.

## Post-build — Real-document hardening (from a live Aadhaar test)

- **D40 — VID + DOB detectors + new entity types.** A real Aadhaar leaked its
  16-digit Virtual ID (survived redaction) and DOB. Added `EntityType.VID` /
  `EntityType.DOB`, keyword-anchored detectors (`\bVID\b`, `DOB:`), severity
  weights, masking (DOB fully masked), and compliance guidance. Keying on the
  label avoids card/date false positives.
- **D41 — Deterministic name detection (`detection/names.py`).** spaCy misses
  Indian/transliterated names ("Makilesh M") while mislabelling "Tamil Nadu" as a
  person. Rather than ship a heavy NER model (deploy memory), names are caught by
  document *structure* that generalizes across IDs, bank statements, HR records,
  invoices, and letters: field labels (`Name:`, `Account Holder:`), relation
  prefixes (`S/O`, `D/O`), salutations (`Mr.`, `Smt.`), and addressees (`To`). The
  addressee scan skips non-Latin lines so it reaches the romanized name on IDs.
- **D42 — Occurrence-complete redaction (`masker.redact_all_occurrences`).**
  Detection may match a repeated value once, but a sanitized export must leave no
  occurrence. TXT export now replaces every occurrence of each detected value
  (longest-first, alphanumeric-boundary guarded to avoid substring over-redaction)
  — mirroring what the PDF export already does via `search_for`. Findings stay
  distinct (clean counts/table); redaction is exhaustive.
- **D43 — NER value-dedup + inventory intent.** Repeated spaCy tokens (a town
  printed 5× on an ID) collapse to one finding; "what sensitive data exists?" is
  answered deterministically from findings instead of wrongly refusing.
- **Known limitation:** spaCy `en_core_web_sm` still over-tags some geographic
  terms (over-redaction, never a leak). A transformer NER (`en_core_web_trf`) would
  fix precision but is too heavy for the free-tier deploy — logged as a future
  improvement.

## Post-build — Manual sample review (all 9 categories)

Ran 9 realistic sample docs (KYC, PAN form, emails, bank statement, invoice,
config file, payslip, NDA, CSV) through the full pipeline. Fixes:

- **D44 — DOB written forms.** "15 August 1985" / "Aug 15, 1985" now detected
  (previously only `DD/MM/YYYY`), keyed on the DOB label so other dates are safe.
- **D45 — First/Last/Given/Surname labels.** Added to the name detector so split
  name fields are caught, not just "Name:".
- **D46 — OpenAI project keys.** `sk-proj-…` (dashes) now matched by the dedicated
  `openai-key` detector (previously only caught via the `api_key:` label).
- **D47 — LLM contextual: truncation + whitespace tolerance (recall bug).** The
  NDA returned **zero** confidential findings because (a) the JSON was truncated at
  `max_output_tokens` → parse failed, and (b) the verbatim-snippet guard rejected
  snippets whose mid-sentence newlines the LLM had normalized. Fixed by raising the
  budget to 2048, salvaging complete objects from truncated JSON, and a
  whitespace-tolerant `_locate_snippet` that maps back to the original offsets.
  This also lifts the previously-low CONFIDENTIAL_INFO recall. Anti-hallucination
  guarantee preserved (snippet must still exist in the source modulo whitespace).
- Regression tests: `test_manual_samples.py` (per-file coverage + decoy rejection
  + redaction leak checks) and `test_llm_contextual.py` (parse/locate). 119 total.

## Post-build — Hybrid RAG (borrowed from ma-diligence-rag-engine)

- **D30 — Adopt hybrid dense+sparse retrieval with RRF.** The reference repo's
  flagship RAG technique. Added an in-house Okapi `BM25` + `reciprocal_rank_fusion`
  (`src/rag/lexical.py`, stdlib only — no new dependency) and `FaissStore.
  search_hybrid()`. Rationale: exact tokens (field labels like "IFSC", "employee
  id", "password") are matched by BM25 while embeddings handle semantics — directly
  relevant to sensitive-data docs. BM25 is rebuilt from persisted chunk text on
  load (no extra files). Toggle: `enable_hybrid_search`.
- **D31 — Preserve the cosine-based grounding contract under hybrid.** RRF sets the
  *ordering*, but the returned score stays the absolute dense cosine, so the
  `rag_min_score` refusal gate keeps its meaning and out-of-scope questions still
  refuse (verified by test).
- **D32 — Deliberately did NOT adopt** the reference's cross-encoder reranker
  (bge-reranker-v2-m3), bge-m3 1024-d embeddings, parent-child expansion, or the
  LangGraph/Qdrant/query-rewrite machinery. Rationale: heavy models + latency +
  VRAM for marginal gain on short compliance docs; MiniLM + hybrid + refusal is
  the right cost/quality point for this app. These remain easy future add-ons.

## Post-build — Model registry update + local Ollama fallback

- **D28 — Refreshed Gemini registry to user-provided current free-tier models.**
  Priority order tuned for this workload (JSON extraction + RAG synthesis):
  `gemini-3.5-flash` (10 RPM / 1500 RPD) → `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (15/1000) →
  `gemini-2.5-flash` (10/250) → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (5/100) →
  `gemini-2.5-pro` (5/100). Lead with high-RPD flash tiers to survive limits; keep
  pro tiers as mid fallbacks. Values still to be re-verified at the rate-limits URL.
- **D29 — Local Ollama as the final, quota-free rotation fallback.** Added a
  `provider` field to `ModelSpec`; `Settings` appends an Ollama entry
  (default `qwen2.5:14b`) to the single `model_registry` so the rotation loop stays
  uniform (cloud first, local last). `ModelSpec` chosen for a 12GB-VRAM GPU
  (RTX 5070 Ti): qwen2.5:14b (~9GB Q4) has strong instruction-following/JSON;
  reasoning models (deepseek-r1) and >12GB models (gpt-oss:20b) were rejected as
  poorer fits for clean structured output / VRAM budget. The client dispatches by
  provider (`_invoke_ollama` uses stdlib `urllib`, no new dependency) and
  `is_configured` is true if *any* backend (Gemini key or Ollama) is available —
  so the app runs fully offline with no Gemini key.

## Phase 9

- **D26 — Hash questions in the audit log.** User questions may themselves contain
  PII, so only a sha256[:12] + length is stored, never the verbatim text — keeps
  the log PII-free while preserving de-dup/traceability.
- **D27 — Per-doc_id caches are the multi-doc mechanism.** Findings/risk/store/
  summary caches keyed by content hash mean switching documents is inherently
  correct and re-uploads are instant; corpus mode merges the per-doc stores.

## Phase 8

- **D24 — True PDF redaction via `apply_redactions()`.** Redaction annotations
  remove the underlying glyphs, so exported PDFs cannot leak values by copy-paste
  or re-extraction (verified by test). OCR-only pages fall back to the safe TXT
  export since coordinates are unavailable.
- **D25 — Exporters in `redaction/export.py`, primitives in `masker.py`.** Keeps
  masking rules single-sourced while isolating heavy `fitz`/`pandas` usage (lazy
  imports) from the detection path that only needs `mask_value`/`redact_text`.

## Phase 6

- **D20 — Embed MASKED text only.** Chunks are redacted before embedding so raw
  PII never enters the vector store or disk. Segment-level redaction preserves
  page/line metadata for citations.
- **D21 — Local sentence-transformers for embeddings.** Keeps RAG indexing off the
  Gemini free-tier quota (which is reserved for synthesis/contextual detection).
- **D22 — Counting questions answered from deterministic findings.** "How many
  emails?" must equal the detector, so it bypasses the LLM entirely; the LLM only
  phrases free-text answers.
- **D23 — Cosine-floor refusal + persisted FAISS keyed by doc hash.** Retrieval
  below `rag_min_score` triggers an explicit "not enough information" refusal
  (no guessing); indexes persist per doc_id for instant re-uploads.

## Phase 5

- **D19 — Mild, thresholded density factor.** `1 + 0.1·max(0, findings/pages − 3)`
  so concentration only raises risk for genuinely dense documents and never
  destabilizes the base weighted score. Thresholds recalibrated to Medium 10 /
  High 30 so a single critical entity is at least Medium.
